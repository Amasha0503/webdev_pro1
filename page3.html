	<p>My favorite movie series is How to Train Your Dragon because it’s a beautiful story about friendship, growth, and understanding. I love how Hiccup and Toothless form such a strong bond, showing that trust and kindness can overcome fear and differences. The journey they go on together—from being outcasts to becoming heroes—is both inspiring and emotional. The animation is stunning, especially the flying scenes, and the music adds so much feeling to every moment. This series always leaves me feeling hopeful and reminds me that true strength comes from being yourself and standing up for what’s right.</p>
